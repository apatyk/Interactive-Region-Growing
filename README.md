# Interactive-Region-Growing

## Overview
### Region Growing with GUI written in Microsoft Visual Studio

This project depicts a region growing algorithm by coloring pixels as they join a region. The program allows users to play the animation continuously or in a step mode (pixel-by-pixel) as the user presses the key "j". This mode can be changed while the region is growing. Furthermore, it is possible for the user to change the absolute difference of pixel intensity that allows a pixel to join a region as well as the distance from the centroid of a region that a pixel can join. 

## Usage

This program only works on PPM images.
